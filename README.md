## About Project
This is a Traffic Light simulator coded in emu8086. Emu8086 is a Microprocessor Emulator with an integrated 8086 Assembler.

### Objective 
- To design a working simulation of traffic-light on crossroad
- The long term goal of the project is to create a dynamic traffic light system that would avoid traffic and would ensure safety. 
- It would decrease the accident level on roads due to traffic light failure.

### Abstract
- The efforts required in achieving the desired output can be effectively and economically be decreased by the implementation of better designs and algorithm. Traffic Lights play a crucial role in regulating traffic across street to prevent confusion and ambiguity, thus traffic light somehow also regulates our economy. 
- The traffic light work on the principle of circular queue without any external intervention, thus this automated solution can help in reducing errors in operation to maximum extent.
- The significance and purpose of this project is to provide a algorithm that consumes less space and time.
